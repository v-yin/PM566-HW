# Data Scraping

## Using the NCBI API, look for papers that show up under the term “sars-cov-2 trial vaccine.” Look for the data in the pubmed database, and then retrieve the details of the paper as shown in lab 7. How many papers were you able to find?

``` r
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2+trial+vaccine")
# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")
# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)
# Extracting the data using regex
# stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

There are 4,007 papers on “sars-cov-2 trial vaccine”.

## Using the list of pubmed ids you retrieved, download each papers’ details using the query parameter rettype = abstract. If you get more than 250 ids, just keep the first 250.

``` r
library(httr)
query_ids <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db      = "pubmed",
    term    = "sars-cov-2 trial vaccine",
    retmax  = 250
  ), 
)
# Extracting the content of the response of GET
ids <- httr::content(query_ids)

ids <- as.character(ids)
# Find all the ids 
ids <- stringr::str_extract_all(ids, "<Id>[[:digit:]]+</Id>")[[1]]
# Remove all the leading and trailing <Id> </Id>. Make use of "|"
ids <- stringr::str_remove_all(ids, "</?Id>")
```

## As we did in lab 7. Create a dataset containing the following:

## Pubmed ID number, Title of the paper, Name of the journal where it was published, Publication date, and Abstract of the paper (if any).

``` r
publications <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db  = "pubmed",
    id  = paste(ids,collapse = ","),
  retmax = 250,
  rettype = "abstract"
    )
)
# Extracting the content of the response of GET
publications <- httr::content(publications)

pub_char_list <- xml2::xml_children(publications)
pub_char_list <- sapply(pub_char_list, as.character)

# Get abstracts
abstracts <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<Abstract>[[:print:][:space:]]+</Abstract>")

abstracts <- str_remove_all(abstracts, "</?[[:alnum:]- =\"]+>") 

abstracts <- str_replace_all(abstracts, "[[:space:]]+"," ")


# Get titles
titles <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<ArticleTitle>[[:print:][:space:]]+</ArticleTitle>")

titles <- str_remove_all(titles, "</?[[:alnum:]- =\"]+>")

# Get journal
journals <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<Title>[[:print:][:space:]]+</Title>")

journals <- str_remove_all(journals, "</?[[:alnum:]- =\"]+>")

# Get publication date
dates <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<PubDate>[[:print:][:space:]]+</PubDate>")

dates <- str_remove_all(dates, "</?[[:alnum:]- =\"]+>\n")

# Dataset
database <- data.frame(
  PubMedId = ids,
  Title    = titles,
  Journal = journals,
  PubDate = dates,
  Abstract = abstracts
)

knitr::kable(database[1:5,], caption = "Some recent papers about Covid19 trial vaccine")
```

| 36322837 | Covid-19 Vaccine Protection among Children and Adolescents in Qatar.                                                                                                                                                  | The New England journal of medicine          | <Year>2022 <Month>Nov <Day>02 </PubDate> | The BNT162b2 vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has been authorized for use in children 5 to 11 years of age and adolescents 12 to 17 years of age but in different antigen doses. We assessed the real-world effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children and adolescents in Qatar. To compare the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the national cohort of vaccinated participants with the incidence in the national cohort of unvaccinated participants, we conducted three matched, retrospective, target-trial, cohort studies - one assessing data obtained from children 5 to 11 years of age after the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant became prevalent and two assessing data from adolescents 12 to 17 years of age before the emergence of the omicron variant (pre-omicron study) and after the omicron variant became prevalent. Associations were estimated with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Among children, the overall effectiveness of the 10-μg primary vaccine series against infection with the omicron variant was 25.7% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 10.0 to 38.6). Effectiveness was highest (49.6%; 95% CI, 28.5 to 64.5) right after receipt of the second dose but waned rapidly thereafter and was negligible after 3 months. Effectiveness was 46.3% (95% CI, 21.5 to 63.3) among children 5 to 7 years of age and 16.6% (95% CI, -4.2 to 33.2) among those 8 to 11 years of age. Among adolescents, the overall effectiveness of the 30-μg primary vaccine series against infection with the omicron variant was 30.6% (95% CI, 26.9 to 34.1), but many adolescents had been vaccinated months earlier. Effectiveness waned over time since receipt of the second dose. Effectiveness was 35.6% (95% CI, 31.2 to 39.6) among adolescents 12 to 14 years of age and 20.9% (95% CI, 13.8 to 27.4) among those 15 to 17 years of age. In the pre-omicron study, the overall effectiveness of the 30-μg primary vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2 infection among adolescents was 87.6% (95% CI, 84.0 to 90.4) and waned relatively slowly after receipt of the second dose. Vaccination in children was associated with modest, rapidly waning protection against omicron infection. Vaccination in adolescents was associated with stronger, more durable protection, perhaps because of the larger antigen dose. (Funded by Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar and others.).

| 36320825 | Withholding methotrexate after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov19 in patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis in India (MIVAC I and II): results of two, parallel, assessor-masked, randomised controlled trials. | The Lancet. Rheumatology                     | <Year>2022 <Month>Nov </PubDate>         | There is a necessity for an optimal COVID-19 vaccination strategy for vulnerable population groups, including people with autoimmune inflammatory arthritis on immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, which inhibit vaccine-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we aimed to assess the effects of withholding methotrexate for 2 weeks after each dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine (MIVAC I) or only after the second dose of vaccine (MIVAC II) compared with continuation of methotrexate, in terms of post-vaccination antibody titres and disease flare rates. MIVAC I and II were two parallel, independent, assessor-masked, randomised trials. The trials were done at a single centre (Dr Shenoy’s Centre for Arthritis and Rheumatism Excellence; Kochi, India) in people with either rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis with stable disease activity, who had been on a fixed dose of methotrexate for the preceding 6 weeks. Those with previous COVID-19 or who were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies were excluded from the trials. People on high-dose corticosteroids and rituximab were also excluded, whereas other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were allowed. In MIVAC I, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to stop methotrexate treatment for 2 weeks after each vaccine dose or to continue methotrexate treatment. In MIVAC II, participants who had continued methotrexate during the first dose of vaccine were randomly assigned (1:1) to withhold methotrexate for 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine or to continue to take methotrexate. The treating physician was masked to the group assignments. The primary outcome for both MIVAC I and MIVAC II was the titre (absolute value) of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody measured 4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. All analyses were done per protocol. The trials were registered with the Clinical Trials Registry- India, number CTRI/2021/07/034639 (MIVAC I) and CTRI/2021/07/035307 (MIVAC II). Between July 6 and Dec 15, 2021, participants were recruited to the trials. In MIVAC I, 250 participants were randomly assigned and 158 completed the study as per the protocol (80 in the methotrexate hold group and 78 in the control group; 148 \[94%\] were women and 10 \[6%\] were men). The median post-vaccination antibody titres in the methotrexate hold group were significantly higher compared with the control group (2484·0 IU/mL, IQR 1050·0-4388·8 vs 1147·5 IU/mL, 433·5-2360·3; p=0·0014). In MIVAC II, 178 participants were randomly assigned and 157 completed the study per protocol (76 in the methotrexate hold group and 81 in the control group; 135 \[86%\] were women and 22 \[14%\] were men). The methotrexate hold group had higher post-vaccination antibody titres compared with the control group (2553·5 IU/ml, IQR 1792·5-4823·8 vs 990·5, 356·1-2252·5; p\<0·0001). There were no reports of any serious adverse events during the trial period. Withholding methotrexate after both ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine doses and after only the second dose led to higher anti-RBD antibody titres compared with continuation of methotrexate. However, withholding methotrexate only after the second vaccine dose resulted in a similar humoral response to holding methotrexate after both vaccine doses, without an increased risk of arthritis flares. Hence, interruption of methotrexate during the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine appears to be a safe and effective strategy to improve the antibody response in patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis.

Vaccination of frontline essential workers (e.g. health care workers) is very important, especially during a pandemic. We tested the efficacy of a 4-week online, peer-led intervention (Harnessing Online Peer Education) to promote requests for COVID-19 vaccine information among essential workers. Participants (N = 120) and peer leaders (N = 12) were recruited through online advertisements from July 23 to August 20, 2021. Eligibility criteria included: 18 years or older, U.S. resident, English speaker, part of phase 1a or 1 b of COVID-19 vaccine rollout (e.g. frontline essential workers), hadn’t received a COVID-19 vaccine but able to receive one. This was a parallel assignment randomised trial. STATA was used to create a randomisation using a random number generator so that all possible assignments of participants and peer leaders to groups were equally likely. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention or control arms that consisted of two private, hidden Facebook groups, each with 30 participants. Peer leaders were randomly assigned to an intervention group, each with six peer leaders. Participants in the intervention arm were randomly assigned to three peer leaders. Participants were blinded after assignment. Peer leaders were tasked with reaching out to their assigned participants at least three times each week. Participants completed a baseline and a post intervention survey. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.org under identifier NCT04376515 and is no longer recruiting. This work was supported by the NIAID under grant 5R01AI132030-05. A total of 101 participants analysed (50 intervention and 51 control). Six people in the intervention group and 0 people in the control group requested vaccine information. Ten people in the intervention group and six people in the control group provided proof of vaccination. The odds of requesting vaccine information in the intervention group was 13 times that in the control group (95% confidence interval: (1.5, 1772), p-value = 0.015). Thirty-seven participants in the intervention group and 31 in the control group were engaged at some point during the study. Results suggest peer-led online community groups may help to disseminate health information, aid public health efforts, and combat vaccine hesitancy.

| 36307830 | Improving pediatric COVID-19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool (MoVeUp): study protocol for a randomized, controlled trial.                                                                                        | Trials                                       | <Year>2022 <Month>Oct <Day>28 </PubDate> | Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines demonstrate excellent effectiveness against infection, severe disease, and death. However, pediatric COVID-19 vaccination rates lag among individuals from rural and other medically underserved communities. The research objective of the current protocol is to determine the effectiveness of a vaccine communication mobile health (mHealth) application (app) on parental decisions to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Custodial parents/caregivers with ≥ 1 child eligible for COVID-19 vaccination who have not yet received the vaccine will be randomized to download one of two mHealth apps. The intervention app will address logistical and motivational barriers to pediatric COVID-19 vaccination. Participants will receive eight weekly push notifications followed by two monthly push notifications (cues to action) regarding vaccinating their child. Through branching logic, users will access customized content based on their locality, degree of rurality-urbanicity, primary language (English/Spanish), race/ethnicity, and child’s age to address COVID-19 vaccine knowledge and confidence gaps. The control app will provide push notifications and information on general pediatric health and infection prevention and mitigation strategies based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The primary outcome is the proportion of children who complete COVID-19 vaccination series. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of children who receive ≥ 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine and changes in parent/caregiver scores from baseline to immediately post-intervention on the modified WHO SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Scale adapted for the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic inflicts disproportionate harm on individuals from underserved communities, including those in rural settings. Maximizing vaccine uptake in these communities will decrease infection rates, severe illness, and death. Given that most US families from these communities use smart phones, mHealth interventions hold the promise of broad uptake. Bundling multiple mHealth vaccine uptake interventions into a single app may maximize the impact of deploying such a tool to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The new knowledge to be gained from this study will directly inform future efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates across diverse settings and provide an evidentiary base for app-based vaccine communication tools that can be adapted to future vaccine-deployment efforts.

The traditional approaches such as high throughput screening (HTS) and combinatorial chemistry are lengthy and expensive to the pharmaceutical industry as they can only handle a smaller dataset. Deep learning (DL) is a sophisticated AI method that uses a thorough comprehension of particular systems. The pharmaceutical industry is now adopting DL techniques to enhance the research and development process. Multi-oriented algorithms play a crucial role in the processing of QSAR analysis, de novo drug design, ADME evaluation, physicochemical analysis, preclinical development, followed by clinical trial data precision. In this study, we investigated the performance of several algorithms, including deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multi-task learning (MTL), with the aim of generating high-quality, interpretable big and diverse databases for drug design and development. Studies have demonstrated that CNN, recurrent neural network and deep belief network are compatible, accurate and effective for the molecular description of pharmacodynamic properties. In Covid-19, existing pharmacological compounds has also been repurposed using DL models. In the absence of the Covid-19 vaccine, remdesivir and oseltamivir have been widely employed to treat severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. In conclusion, the results indicate the potential benefits of employing the DL strategies in the drug discovery process.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

# Text Mining

## A new dataset has been added to the data science data repository <https://github.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/tree/master/03_pubmed>. The dataset contains 3241 abstracts from articles across 5 search terms. Your job is to analyse these abstracts to find interesting insights.

``` r
pubmed <- read.csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/03_pubmed/pubmed.csv")

pubmed <- data.table(pubmed)

Most common tokens for each search term with stopwords

The top words, without removing stop words, are largely uninteresting.
Stop words occupy the top 5 most frequent words in the data set for each
of the search terms except for prostate cancer, which returned “cancer”
and “prostate” at 4th and 5th place.

Most common tokens for each search term WITHOUT stopwords

After removing the stop words, the top 5 words for each term are much
different and appear to describe the term word better. It is interesting
that “patient” appears in the top 5 for each term except for
preeclampsia, where “women” is in the top 5 instead.

## Tokenize the abstracts into bigrams. Find the 10 most common bigram and visualize them with ggplot2.

``` r
pubmed %>%
  unnest_ngrams(bigram, abstract, n=2) %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, fct_reorder(bigram, n))) +
  geom_col() +
  ylab("Abstract Bigram")+
  ggtitle("Top 10 most common bigrams in the abstract dataset")
```

Some stopwords are top bigrams(of the, in the, and the, to the), however
covid 19 is the most common bigram in the abstracts. Some of the other
search terms appear here as well (pre eclampsia, prostate cancer)

## Calculate the TF-IDF value for each word-search term combination. (here you want the search term to be the “document”) What are the 5 tokens from each search term with the highest TF-IDF value? How are the results different from the answers you got in question 1?

``` r
pubmed %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, abstract) %>%
  count(word, term) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, term, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  group_by(term) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Highest TF-IDF value words by search term")
```

Highest TF-IDF value words by search term

Looking at TF-IDF values, the highest value word is the same as the most
common word, except for cystic fibrosis, where the highest TF-IDF word
is “cf” whereas the most common word is “fibrosis”. The rest of the top
5 words per term appear to be more descriptive of the term than the most
common words (ie for term “meningitis”, we see “pachymeningitis” as a
top TF-IDF word whereas we saw “clinical” and “patient” as most common
words).
